                                    <p>  Feeling no joy, having no interest in anything, and not wanting to engage in activities is a state many people experience at some point in their lives. Although it sounds like depression, it is not accompanied by hopelessness. While it feels similar to burnout, individuals in this state can still find some energy and interest in life. This emotional fatigue, dullness, and aimlessness can be described by the term “languishing”, which captures this exact experience. Although it resembles depression symptoms such as loss of interest and lack of enjoyment, it is not full-blown depression. However, it is also not a state of complete well-being, as people in this condition struggle to function at their full capacity and show little enthusiasm or joy. </p>
                                   <p> Languishing disrupts motivation and focus, pushing individuals to withdraw from tasks. It can also trigger psychological disorders, including depression. People in this state tend to use more negative expressions in daily life, such as “My job is awful,” “I feel neglected,” or “Everything is boring.” But is languishing merely a personal experience, or is it also connected to our relationships and social bonds? </p>
                                   <p>  Well-being is not solely an individual experience; it is also shaped by one’s context and cultural factors. The role of personal connections and the context in determining whether someone experiences languishing or flourishing (a state of thriving) is crucial. For instance, individuals experiencing flourishing tend to build relationships based on mutual support, solidarity, and shared benefits, whereas those in a languishing state may prioritize their personal needs over mutual interactions. These differences can vary across cultural contexts as well.  </p>
                                   <p>  In East Asian cultures, happiness and well-being are often defined through a collective sense of self, emphasizing interdependence, harmony, and concern for others’ well-being. In contrast, Western cultures associate happiness with individual satisfaction and subjective well-being. From this perspective, it can be argued that those experiencing languishing tend to align more closely with the individualistic tendencies of Western societies.  </p>
                                   <p>  Research shows that understanding an individual’s needs and values is critical for coping with languishing. In other words, selecting activities that match one’s current well-being level is essential. For example, individuals experiencing languishing can begin by focusing on self-compassion and social support skills and later progress to activities that promote mutual appreciation and relational support. This gradual approach helps individuals start from their current state and move toward higher levels of well-being.  </p>
                                   <p> Well-being is not a fixed state but a dynamic process shaped by individuals’ needs, relationships, and context. It is essential to understand the differences between languishing and flourishing and address different needs accordingly. Simply “not being depressed” does not mean someone is not struggling. Recognizing the state of languishing, acknowledging this silent struggle, and seeking a way out are important steps toward well-being.
